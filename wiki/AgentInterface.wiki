=Actions=

To create an ABL agent, it is necessary to provide an `ActionListener` as a parameter to the agent. This listener will be informed when the agent has selected actions to perform. An action listener must implement the following methods: 

  * `public void execute(ActionNode action)`
    * Informs the listener that an action has been selected for execution. 

  * `public void onUpdate(ActionNode action)`
    * Informs the listener that the action is executing during a decision cycle. 
  
  * `public void abort(ActionNode action)` 
    * Informs the listener that an executing action should be aborted.
